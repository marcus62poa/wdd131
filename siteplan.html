            <h2>1. Site Name & Rationale</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>TrailSeeker Adventures <div class="logo-placeholder">TSA</div>
            </h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The name works because it strongly suggests **exploration** and **outdoor
                activity** ("TrailSeeker"). It's memorable and relevant to the target audience (hikers, campers).
                Potential domain: <code>trailseeker.guide</code></p>

            <h2>2. Site Core Purpose</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The main goal is to be the **most trusted digital guide for advanced outdoor enthusiasts** in the
                Mountain West. It will provide **curated, up-to-date trail maps, critical gear lists, and essential
                backcountry safety protocols**. The purpose is to ensure users have all information needed for safe,
                challenging, and successful nature exploration.</p>

            <h2>3. User Scenarios: Target Audience Questions</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Target audience: Experienced outdoors people (25-55) looking for reliable, in-depth data.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>🤔 **Scenario 1:** *Which 3-day backpacking loop near Moab has the highest elevation gain and
                    guaranteed, reliable year-round water access?* (Needs high-detail filtering on difficulty and
                    logistics.)</li>
                <li>🤔 **Scenario 2:** *What is the difference between a synthetic and down sleeping bag required for
                    unexpected temperature drops down to 10°F during a late-fall camping trip?* (Needs expert gear and
                    condition-specific advice.)</li>
